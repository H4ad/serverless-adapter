To start to use, first you need to know what you need to import, let's start showing the [ServerlessAdapter](/docs/api/ServerlessAdapter).

```tsx
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
```

We need to pass to [Serverless Adapter](/docs/api/ServerlessAdapter) the instance of your api, let's look an example with:

- Framework: [Express](../frameworks/express).
- Adapters: [AWS Api Gateway V2 Adapter](../adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2).
- Handler: [Default Handler](../handlers/default).
- Resolver: [Promise Resolver](../resolvers/promise).

```ts
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { ExpressFramework } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/frameworks/express';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';
import { PromiseResolver } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/resolvers/promise';
import { ApiGatewayV2Adapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws';

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  .addAdapter(new ApiGatewayV2Adapter())
  // if you need more adapters
  // just append more `addAdapter` calls
  .build();
```
