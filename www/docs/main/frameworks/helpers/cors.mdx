This framework is a helper framework that wraps around another framework and gets some options to configure CORS in your app using the [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) library behind the scenes.

## Why?

Why should I use this framework instead of directly using my framework/application's `joe-doe-cors` package?

Using this framework, you can skip the `request` to your framework, so it's faster to handle it directly in the library instead of leaving it
to your frame.

Also, frameworks like `trpc`, `deepá¸±it` and other frameworks don't have a good way of dealing with CORS, so with `CorsFramework` you can do the CORS
works for these frameworks.

Finally, I added an optimization, inspired by [access control](https://github.com/primus/access-control/blob/master/index.js#L95-L115), which returns the Forbidden error when the origin is invalid
or when the method is not allowed. In other packages, like `fastify/cors`, the `cors` itself used by this library and [even other languages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57212248/why-is-http-request-been-processed-in-action-even-when-cors-is-not-enabled),
they process the request if the origin is invalid and to me it sounds like a waste of resources, so we can just return the error to the user instead of processing the request which is sure to return the error in the user's browser.

> If you want to disable this behaviour, set `{ forbiddenOnInvalidOriginOrMethod: false }` in the options.

## Requirements

To be able to use, first you need to install some packages:

```bash
npm i --save cors
```

If you are using TypeScript:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/cors
```

## Usage

The first parameter is the instance of another framework, so if you want to use [Express](../express) for example, you can just use like this:

```ts
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { CorsFramework, CorsFrameworkOptions } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/frameworks/cors';
import { ExpressFramework } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/frameworks/express';

const express = require('express');

const expressFramework = new ExpressFramework();
// see docs about the options in the original package:
// https://github.com/expressjs/cors
const options: CorsFrameworkOptions = { origin: '*' };
const framework = new CorsFramework(expressFramework, options);

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(express)
  .setFramework(framework)
  // continue to set the other options here.
  //.setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  //.setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  //.addAdapter(new AlbAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // after put all methods necessary, just call the build method.
  .build();
```

:::tip

Is your application instance creation asynchronous? Look the [LazyFramework](./lazy) which helps you in asynchronous startup.
