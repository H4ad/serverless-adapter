First, you need to ensure you have the libs installed, so run this code:

```bash
npm i --save express
npm i --save-dev @types/express
```

Then, you need you just need to use the [ExpressFramework](../../api/Frameworks/ExpressFramework) when you create your adapter, like:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { ExpressFramework } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/frameworks/express';

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  // continue to set the other options here.
  //.setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  //.setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  //.addAdapter(new AlbAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // after put all methods necessary, just call the build method.
  .build();
```

Is your application instance creation asynchronous? Look the [LazyFramework](./helpers/lazy) which helps you in asynchronous startup.
