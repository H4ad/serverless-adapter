:::info

The following examples only work with deepkit over HTTP, you cannot use this framework to support websocket or rpc.

:::

First, you need to ensure you have the libs installed, so run this code:

```bash
npm i --save @deepkit/app @deepkit/core @deepkit/framework @deepkit/http @deepkit/type @deepkit/type-compiler
```

Then, you need you just need to use the [HttpDeepkitFramework](../../api/Frameworks/HttpDeepkitFramework) when you create your adapter, like:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { FrameworkModule } from '@deepkit/framework';
import { HtmlResponse, HttpKernel, HttpModule, HttpRouterRegistry } from '@deepkit/http';
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { HttpDeepkitFramework } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/frameworks/deepkit';

const app = new App({
  controllers: [],
  module: [
    new HttpModule(),
    new FrameworkModule()
  ],
});

const router = app.get(HttpRouterRegistry);

router.get('/', () => {
  return new HtmlResponse('<h1>Sample in Deepkit Project</h1>');
});

const httpKernel = app.get(HttpKernel);

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(httpKernel)
  .setFramework(new HttpDeepkitFramework())
  // .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  // .addAdapter(new AlbAdapter())
  // .addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  // .addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // after put all methods necessary, just call the build method.
  .build();
```

Is your application instance creation asynchronous? Look the [LazyFramework](./helpers/lazy) which helps you in asynchronous startup.

## About AWS

I was only able to get Deepkit working when you deploy using NodeJS 16.x and using the `x86_64` architecture.

Also, I tried using the `serverless-offline` package and it throws an error about `could not find handler`, not sure why
I changed the deployment configuration to upload code manually. So if you like to use `serverless framework`, know
that you will have problems trying to test locally.

### FAQ

### ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED

Error message: /var/task/node_modules/turbo-net/build/Release/turbo_net.node: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Solution: Change your lambda architecture to `x86_64`.

### ENOENT

Error message: no such file or directory, mkdir 'var/debug/'
Solution:

```ts
// change these options
new HttpModule({ debug: true }),
new FrameworkModule({ debug: true, httpLog: true }),
// for
new HttpModule({ debug: false }),
new FrameworkModule({ debug: false, httpLog: false }),
```

Need to deal with CORS? See [CorsFramework](./helpers/cors) which helps you to add correct headers.
