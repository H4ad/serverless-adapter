:::info

The following examples only work with deepkit over HTTP, you cannot use this framework to support websocket or rpc.

:::

First, you need to ensure you have the libs installed, so run this code:

```bash
npm i --save @deepkit/app @deepkit/core @deepkit/framework @deepkit/http @deepkit/type @deepkit/type-compiler
```

Then, you need you just need to use the [HttpDeepkitFramework](../../api/Frameworks/HttpDeepkitFramework) when you create your adapter, like:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { FrameworkModule } from '@deepkit/framework';
import { HtmlResponse, HttpKernel, HttpModule, HttpRouterRegistry } from '@deepkit/http';
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { HttpDeepkitFramework } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/frameworks/deepkit';

const app = new App({
  controllers: [],
  module: [new HttpModule(), new FrameworkModule({
    port: +process.env.PORT,
  })],
});

const router = app.get(HttpRouterRegistry);

router.get('/', () => {
  return new HtmlResponse('<h1>Sample in Deepkit Project</h1>');
});

const httpKernel = app.get(HttpKernel);

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(httpKernel)
  .setFramework(new HttpDeepkitFramework())
  // .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  // .addAdapter(new AlbAdapter())
  // .addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  // .addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // after put all methods necessary, just call the build method.
  .build();
```

Is your application instance creation asynchronous? Look the [LazyFramework](./lazy) which helps you in asynchronous startup.
