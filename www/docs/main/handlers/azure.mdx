:::tip

Don't know what a handler is? See the [Architecture](../architecture#handler) section.

:::

This is a implementation that will return a function that expect to receive the following arguments: context and event, respectively.

```js
function(context, event) {...}
```

## Requirements

First, install the types for this adapter:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @azure/functions@3.x
```

## Customize

By default we use [log property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node?tabs=v2-v3-v4-export%2Cv2-v3-v4-done%2Cv2%2Cv2-log-custom-telemetry%2Cv2-accessing-request-and-response%2Cwindows-setting-the-node-version#contextlog-method) inside `Context` as default logger for this library .

We detect when the log instance is created with [createDefaultLogger](../../api/Core/Logger/createDefaultLogger) and then
replace this instance with the instance inside `Context`.

If you want to log using the original instance [createDefaultLogger](../../api/Core/Logger/createDefaultLogger),
you can set the `useContextLogWhenInternalLogger` option to `false` for [AzureHandlerOptions](../../api/Handlers/AzureHandler/AzureHandlerOptions).

```typescript
import { AzureHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/azure';

const handler = new AzureHandler({
  useContextLogWhenInternalLogger: false,
});
```

## Usage

First, you need to configure your `function.json` to be able to receive all requests from Azure.

```json title="function.json"
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "route": "{*segments}"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, you can import and call the method [setHandler](../../api/ServerlessAdapter#method-sethandler), as per the code below:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { AzureHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/azure';
import { PromiseResolver } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/resolvers/promise';
import { HttpTriggerV4Adapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/azure';
import app from './app';

export default ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new AzureHandler())
  .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  // continue to set the other options here.
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .addAdapter(new HttpTriggerV4Adapter())
  .build();
```

:::caution

Be careful when exporting the handler because in azure you must `export default` and in [DefaultHandler](./aws)
you must `export const handler`.

:::

The above code will add support for Azure Http Trigger V4, to learn more about Http Trigger, see the [adapter docs](../adapters/azure/http-trigger-v4).

:::caution Attention

You `MUST` use [PromiseResolver](../resolvers/promise) to integrate with `AzureHandler`, other resolvers didn't work with Azure.

## Examples

You can see examples of how to use [here](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter-examples).
