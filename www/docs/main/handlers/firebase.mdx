Don't know what a handler is? See the [Architecture](../architecture#handler) section.

:::

## Requirements

First, install the types for this adapter:

```bash
npm i --save firebase-functions firebase-admin
```

## V1 and V2

If you want to use Firebase Functions V1, use [HttpFirebaseHandler](../../api/Handlers/HttpFirebaseHandler).

But if you want to add support for V2, then use [HttpFirebaseV2Handler](../../api/Handlers/HttpFirebaseHandler/HttpFirebaseV2Handler).

## Integrating with Http Events

To use, you can import [HttpFirebaseV2Handler](../../api/Handlers/HttpFirebaseHandler/HttpFirebaseV2Handler) and call the method [setHandler](../../api/ServerlessAdapter#method-sethandler), as per the code below:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { DummyAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/dummy';
import { HttpFirebaseV2Handler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/firebase';
import { DummyResolver } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/resolvers/dummy';
import app from './app';

export const helloWorld = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new HttpFirebaseV2Handler({
    // you can pass custom properties here, like: concurrency.
  }))
  .setResolver(new DummyResolver())
  // choose the framework of your app
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .addAdapter(new DummyAdapter())
  .build();

// you can export more than one if you want
export const test = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new HttpFirebaseV2Handler())
  .setResolver(new DummyResolver())
  // choose the framework of your app
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .addAdapter(new DummyAdapter())
  .build();
```

:::info About Resolver and Adapter

You should use `DummyResolver` and `DummyAdapter` because it's a requirement for the library, but `HttpFirebaseV2Handler` doesn't do anything with them,
so you use those dummy versions just to satisfy the library requirements.

## What about Cron, Pub/Sub, etc?

I could not think yet in an API to handle those cases well,
so currently I didn't add support to these type of Firebase Functions.

If you have some idea about a design for those APIs, [create an issue](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/issues/new/choose).

## Examples

You can see examples of how to use [here](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter-examples).
