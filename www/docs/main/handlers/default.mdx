Don't know what a handler is? See the [Architecture](../architecture#handler) section.

:::

This is a serverless handler implementation that will return a function that expect to receive the following arguments: event, context and callback, respectively.

```js
function(event, context, callback) {...}
```

If your cloud's serverless handler signature is the same, you can use this handler.

This is usually enough to add support for clouds like: AWS, Azure, Huawei and others.

# Usage

To use, you can import and call the method [setHandler](../../api/ServerlessAdapter#method-sethandler), as per the code below:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // continue to set the other options here.
  //.setResolver(new AwsContextResolver())
  //.setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  //.addAdapter(new AlbAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  //.addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // after put all methods necessary, just call the build method.
  .build();
```
