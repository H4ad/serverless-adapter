Don't know what a handler is? See the [Architecture](../architecture#handler) section.

## Requirements

First, install the types for this adapter:

```bash
npm i --save @google-cloud/functions-framework
```

## Integrating with Http Events

To use, you can import [GCPHandler](../../api/Handlers/GCPHandler) and call the method [setHandler](../../api/ServerlessAdapter#method-sethandler), as per the code below:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { DummyAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/dummy';
import { GCPHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/gcp';
import { DummyResolver } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/resolvers/dummy';
import app from './app';

const functionName = 'helloWorld';

// this handler don't need to export
ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new GCPHandler(functionName))
  .setResolver(new DummyResolver())
  // choose the framework of your app
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .addAdapter(new DummyAdapter())
  .build();
```

When defining `functionName`, on deploy, you MUST set the `--entry-point` flag when running `gcloud deploy` to the same value.

:::danger Function Version

You MUST use `--gen2` flag when running `gcloud deploy`, this library was designed to only work with `gen2` of Google Cloud Function.

:::

:::info About Resolver and Adapter

You should use `DummyResolver` and `DummyAdapter` because it's a requirement for the library, but `GCPHandler` doesn't do anything with them,
so you use those dummy versions just to satisfy the library requirements.

## What about Pub/Sub, Storage, etc?

I could not think yet in an API to handle those cases well,
so currently I didn't add support to these type of Google Cloud Functions.

If you have some idea about a design for those APIs, [create an issue](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/issues/new/choose).

## Examples

You can see examples of how to use [here](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter-examples).
