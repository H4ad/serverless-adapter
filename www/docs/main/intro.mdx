# Introduction

This library was a refactored version of [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express), I
create a new way to interact and extend event sources by creating contracts to abstract the integrations between each
library layer.

Why you would use this libray instead of [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express)?

- Better APIs to extend library functionality.
  - You don't need me to release a new version to integrate with the new event source, you can create an adapter and
    just call the `addAdapter` method when building your handler.
- All code can be extended, if you want to modify the current behavior you can.
  - This is important because if you find a bug, you can quickly resolve it by extending the class, _and then you can
    submit a PR to fix the bug_.
- All code was written in Typescript.
- Well documented, any method, class, or interface has comments to explain the behavior.
- We have >99% coverage.

## Support

By design we have these contracts that define the layers of the library: Frameworks, Adapters, Resolvers and Handlers.

:::info

If you don't know what each thing means, see [Architecture](./architecture).

:::

Currently, we support these clouds (handlers):

- Azure by using ([AzureHandler](./handlers/azure))
- AWS by using ([DefaultHandler](./handlers/aws))
- Digital Ocean by using ([DigitalOceanHandler](./handlers/digital-ocean))
- Firebase by using ([HttpFirebaseHandler](./handlers/firebase))
- Huawei by using ([HttpHuaweiHandler](./handlers/huawei#http-function)) and ([EventHuaweiHandler](./handlers/huawei#event-function))

Additionally, we support these frameworks:

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) by using ([ApolloServerFramework](./frameworks/apollo-server))
- [Deepkit](https://docs.deepkit.io/) by using ([HttpDeepkitFramework](./frameworks/deepkit))
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) by using ([ExpressFramework](./frameworks/express))
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) by using ([FastifyFramework](./frameworks/fastify))
- [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) by using ([HapiFramework](./frameworks/hapi))
- [Koa](https://koajs.com/) by using ([KoaFramework](./frameworks/koa))
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), see the [documentation about](./frameworks/nestjs) to know how to integrate.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), see the [documentation about](./frameworks/trpc) to know how to integrate.

Additionally, we have some helper frameworks that you can combine with the above frameworks to give more power to your application:

- Async Initialization by using ([LazyFramework](./frameworks/helpers/lazy))
  - Use this framework to provide a way to create the instance of your app asynchronously.
  - With him, you can create an instance of Express or Fastify asynchronously, [see the docs](./frameworks/helpers/lazy).
- CORS support without rely on original framework with ([CorsFramework](./frameworks/helpers/cors))
  - Use this framework to provide a way to handle CORS in frameworks like `trpc`, `deepkit` and others.
  - Or use to get faster responses when method is `OPTIONS`.
- Content Type parsing support without rely on original framework with ([BodyParserFramework](./frameworks/helpers/body-parser))
  - Use this framework to provide a way to handle content type parsing in frameworks like `trpc`, `deepkit` and others.

## Why you create this library?

The real reason I created this library was because I wanted to add API Gateway and SQS support at the same time to save
some money. But, [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express) was not supported, so
I [created a PR](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express/pull/483) ~~but until I finished this library that PR was never accepted~~ and it was merged but it took so long.

So I build my own library based on that library with better APIs so I never have to wait for the maintainer to accept my
PR just to extend the library's functionality :)

## Credits

Honestly, I just refactored all the code that the @vendia team and many other contributors wrote, thanks so much to them
for existing and giving us a brilliant library that is the core of my current company.
