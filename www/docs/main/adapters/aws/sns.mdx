The adapter to handle requests from [AWS SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sns.html).

:::info

The option of `responseWithErrors` is ignored by this adapter and we always call `resolver.fail` with the error.

:::

## Typescript

To correctly type your `body` when receiving the AWS SNS request, you must install `aws-lambda`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/aws-lambda
```

## About the adapter

In AWS SNS, you don't have requests, you just receive the records in the `event` property of the handler.

So, to be able to handle this adapter, by default we create a `POST` request to `/sns` with the `body` being the `event` property as JSON.

```json title="sns-event-example.json"
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "EventVersion": "1.0",
      "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:sns-lambda:21be56ed-a058-49f5-8c98-aedd2564c486",
      "EventSource": "aws:sns",
      "Sns": {
        "SignatureVersion": "1",
        "Timestamp": "2019-01-02T12:45:07.000Z",
        "Signature": "tcc6faL2yUC6dgZdmrwh1Y4cGa/ebXEkAi6RibDsvpi+tE/1+82j...65r==",
        "SigningCertUrl": "https://sns.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-ac565b8b1a6c5d002d285f9598aa1d9b.pem",
        "MessageId": "95df01b4-ee98-5cb9-9903-4c221d41eb5e",
        "Message": "Hello from SNS!",
        "MessageAttributes": {
          "Test": {
            "Type": "String",
            "Value": "TestString"
          },
          "TestBinary": {
            "Type": "Binary",
            "Value": "TestBinary"
          }
        },
        "Type": "Notification",
        "UnsubscribeUrl": "https://sns.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&amp;SubscriptionArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:test-lambda:21be56ed-a058-49f5-8c98-aedd2564c486",
        "TopicArn":"arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:sns-lambda",
        "Subject": "TestInvoke"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Normally, your framework will parse this JSON and return the parsed values as javascript objects.

:::tip

To correctly type your body, you can use:

```ts
import type { SNSEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
```

:::

## Customizing

You can change the HTTP Method and Path that will be used to create the request by sending `snsForwardMethod` and `snsForwardPath` inside [SNSAdapter](/docs/api/Adapters/AWS/SNSAdapter).

## Usage

To add support to AWS SNS you do the following:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { SNSAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';
import app from './app';

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  .addAdapter(new SNSAdapter())
  // customizing:
  // .addAdapter(new SNSAdapter({ snsForwardMethod: '/prod/sns', snsForwardPath: 'PUT' }))
  .build();
```

:::caution

When you configure your API with some `basePath` like `/prod`, you should set `snsForwardPath` as `/prod/sns` instead leave as default `/sns`.

:::

## Security

You **MUST** check if the header `Host` contains the value of `sns.amazonaws.com`.

Without checking this header, if you add this adapter and [AWS API Gateway V2](./api-gateway-v2) adapter, you will be vulnerable to attacks
because anyone can create a `POST` request to `/sns`.
