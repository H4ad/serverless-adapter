Honestly, I added this adapter because @vendia/serverless-adapter had already added support for Lambda Edge, but reading my implementation and @vendia's implementation, I never knew if it actually worked because I didn't test it on AWS.

So at the moment I'm not going to create any documentation and feel free to test this adapter and see how it behaves.

You can read the [source code here](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/blob/main/src/adapters/aws/lambda-edge.adapter.ts) to see how the request and response are being assembled, as well as take a look at [LambdaEdgeAdapterOptions](/docs/api/Adapters/AWS/LambdaEdgeAdapter/LambdaEdgeAdapterOptions) to see what options you can pass.

Despite being lazy to create Lambda Edge documentation, in the code I tried to add as many comments as possible to explain each option.
