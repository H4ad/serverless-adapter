The adapter to handle requests from [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html).

:::info

The option of `responseWithErrors` is ignored by this adapter and we always call `resolver.fail` with the error.

:::

## Typescript

To correctly type your `body` when receiving the AWS DynamoDB request, you must install `aws-lambda`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/aws-lambda
```

So when getting the `body` you should use this type:

```ts title="dynamodb.controller.ts"
import type { DynamoDBStreamEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
```

## About the adapter

In AWS DynamoDB, you don't have requests, you just receive the records in the `event` property of the handler.

So, in order to handle this adapter, by default we create a `POST` request to `/dynamo` with the `body` being the `event` property as JSON.

```json title="dynamodb-event-example.json"
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventID": "1",
      "eventVersion": "1.0",
      "dynamodb": {
        "Keys": {
          "Id": {
            "N": "101"
          }
        },
        "NewImage": {
          "Message": {
            "S": "New item!"
          },
          "Id": {
            "N": "101"
          }
        },
        "StreamViewType": "NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES",
        "SequenceNumber": "111",
        "SizeBytes": 26
      },
      "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
      "eventName": "INSERT",
      "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:111122223333:table/EventSourceTable",
      "eventSource": "aws:dynamodb"
    }
  ]
}
```

Normally, your framework will parse this JSON and return the parsed values as javascript objects.

## Customizing

You can change the HTTP Method and Path that will be used to create the request by sending `dynamoDBForwardMethod` and `dynamoDBForwardPath` inside [DynamoDBAdapterOptions](/docs/api/Adapters/AWS/DynamoDBAdapter/DynamoDBAdapterOptions).

## Usage

To add support to AWS DynamoDB you do the following:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { DynamoDBAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';
import app from './app';

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  .addAdapter(new DynamoDBAdapter())
  // customizing:
  // .addAdapter(new DynamoDBAdapter({ dynamoDBForwardPath: '/prod/dynamo', dynamoDBForwardMethod: 'PUT' }))
  .build();
```

:::caution

When you configure your API with some `basePath` like `/prod`, you should set `dynamoDBForwardPath` as `/prod/dynamo` instead leave as default `/dynamo`.

:::

## Security

You **MUST** check if the header `Host` contains the value of `dynamodb.amazonaws.com`.

Without checking this header, if you add this adapter and [AWS API Gateway V2](./api-gateway-v2) adapter, you will be vulnerable to attacks
because anyone can create a `POST` request to `/dynamo`.

## Batch Item Failures

If you enable this batch item failure option, to be able to partially return that some items failed to process, first configure your Adapter:

```ts
const adapter = new DynamoDBAdapter({
  batch: true,
});
```

And then, just return the following JSON in the route that processes the DynamoDB event.

```json
{
  "batchItemFailures": [
    {
        "itemIdentifier": "id2"
    },
    {
        "itemIdentifier": "id4"
    }
  ]
}
```
