The adapter to handle requests from [AWS EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents.html).

:::info

The option of `responseWithErrors` is ignored by this adapter and we always call `resolver.fail` with the error.

:::

## Typescript

To correctly type your `body` when receiving the AWS EventBridge request, you must install `aws-lambda`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/aws-lambda
```

So when getting the `body` you should use this type:

```ts title="eventbridge.controller.ts"
import type { EventBridgeEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
```

## About the adapter

In AWS EventBridge, you don't have requests, you just receive the info from Cloudwatch Events within `event` property of the handler.

So, in order to handle this adapter, by default we create a `POST` request to `/eventbridge` with the `body` being the `event` property as JSON.

```json title="rds-eventbridge-event-example.json"
{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "fe8d3c65-xmpl-c5c3-2c87-81584709a377",
    "detail-type": "RDS DB Instance Event",
    "source": "aws.rds",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-04-28T07:20:20Z",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:123456789012:db:rdz6xmpliljlb1"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "EventCategories": [
            "backup"
        ],
        "SourceType": "DB_INSTANCE",
        "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-2:123456789012:db:rdz6xmpliljlb1",
        "Date": "2020-04-28T07:20:20.112Z",
        "Message": "Finished DB Instance backup",
        "SourceIdentifier": "rdz6xmpliljlb1"
    }
}
```

And one example with [Schedule expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html):

```json title="scheduled-eventbridge-event-example.json"
{
  "version": "0",
  "account": "123456789012",
  "region": "us-east-2",
  "detail": {},
  "detail-type": "Scheduled Event",
  "source": "aws.events",
  "time": "2019-03-01T01:23:45Z",
  "id": "cdc73f9d-aea9-11e3-9d5a-835b769c0d9c",
  "resources": [
    "arn:aws:events:us-east-2:123456789012:rule/my-schedule"
  ]
}
```

Normally, your framework will parse this JSON and return the parsed values as javascript objects.

## Customizing

You can change the HTTP Method and Path that will be used to create the request by sending `eventBridgeForwardMethod` and `eventBridgeForwardPath` inside [EventBridgeOptions](/docs/api/Adapters/AWS/EventBridgeAdapter/EventBridgeOptions).

## Usage

To add support to AWS EventBridge you do the following:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { EventBridgeAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';
import app from './app';

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  .addAdapter(new EventBridgeAdapter())
  // customizing:
  // .addAdapter(new EventBridgeAdapter({ eventBridgeForwardPath: '/prod/eventbridge', eventBridgeForwardMethod: 'PUT' }))
  .build();
```

:::caution

When you configure your API with some `basePath` like `/prod`, you should set `eventBridgeForwardPath` as `/prod/eventbridge` instead leave as default `/eventbridge`.

:::

## Security

You **MUST** check if the header `Host` contains the value of `events.amazonaws.com`.

Without checking this header, if you add this adapter and [AWS API Gateway V2](./api-gateway-v2) adapter, you will be vulnerable to attacks
because anyone can create a `POST` request to `/eventbridge`.
