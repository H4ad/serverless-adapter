The adapter to handle requests from [AWS SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html).

:::info

The option of `responseWithErrors` is ignored by this adapter and we always call `resolver.fail` with the error.

:::

## Typescript

To correctly type your `body` when receiving the AWS SQS request, you must install `aws-lambda`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/aws-lambda
```

So when getting the `body` you should use this type:

```ts title="sqs.controller.ts"
import type { SQSEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
```

## About the adapter

In AWS SQS, you don't have requests, you just receive the records from the queue in the `event` property of the handler.

So, in order to handle this adapter, by default we create a `POST` request to `/sqs` with the `body` being the `event` property as JSON.

```json title="sqs-event-example.json"
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "messageId": "059f36b4-87a3-44ab-83d2-661975830a7d",
            "receiptHandle": "AQEBwJnKyrHigUMZj6rYigCgxlaS3SLy0a...",
            "body": "Test message.",
            "attributes": {
                "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
                "SentTimestamp": "1545082649183",
                "SenderId": "AIDAIENQZJOLO23YVJ4VO",
                "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1545082649185"
            },
            "messageAttributes": {},
            "md5OfBody": "e4e68fb7bd0e697a0ae8f1bb342846b3",
            "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
            "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-2"
        }
    ]
}
```

Normally, your framework will parse this JSON and return the parsed values as javascript objects.

## Customizing

You can change the HTTP Method and Path that will be used to create the request by sending `sqsForwardMethod` and `sqsForwardPath` inside [SQSAdapterOptions](/docs/api/Adapters/AWS/SQSAdapter/SQSAdapterOptions).

## Usage

To add support to AWS SQS you do the following:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { SQSAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws';
import { DefaultHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/handlers/default';
import app from './app';

export const handler = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DefaultHandler())
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  // .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  .addAdapter(new SQSAdapter())
  // customizing:
  // .addAdapter(new SQSAdapter({ sqsForwardPath: '/prod/sqs', sqsForwardMethod: 'PUT' }))
  .build();
```

:::caution

When you configure your API with some `basePath` like `/prod`, you should set `sqsForwardPath` as `/prod/sqs` instead leave as default `/sqs`.

:::

## Security

You **MUST** check if the header `Host` contains the value of `sqs.amazonaws.com`.

Without checking this header, if you add this adapter and [AWS API Gateway V2](./api-gateway-v2) adapter, you will be vulnerable to attacks
because anyone can create a `POST` request to `/sqs`.
