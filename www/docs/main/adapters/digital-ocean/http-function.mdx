:::caution Attention

Check the [DigitalOceanHandler](../../handlers/digital-ocean) docs to make sure you have all the necessary settings to work with this adapter.

:::

The adapter to handle requests from [DigitalOcean Functions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions/quickstart/sample-functions/).

:::info

When an error is thrown during forwarding and the `responseWithErrors` option is `true`, we return a 500 status WITH error stack in the response.

:::

## Requirements

When you work with DigitalOcean Functions, in the root of your repository you will have a file called `project.yml` which is used
to determine the structure of your functions and will be used to deploy your code to DigitalOcean.

To this library understand the requests coming from DigitalOcean, you need to modify the default code of `project.yml`:

```diff
packages:
  - name: [name-of-your-api]
    functions:
      - name: 'prod'
        main: ''
        runtime: 'nodejs:18'
-        web: true
+        web: 'raw'
```

## About the adapter

This adapter transforms every request coming from DigitalOcean Functions into an HTTP request to your framework.

```json title="digital-ocean-http-function-event-example.json"
{
  "http": {
    "method": "post",
    "queryString": "potato=true",
    "body": "{\"test\":true}",
    "headers": {
      "accept": "*/*",
      "accept-encoding": "gzip",
      "cdn-loop": "cloudflare",
      "cf-connecting-ip": "45.444.444.444",
      "cf-ipcountry": "BR",
      "cf-ray": "xxxxxxxxxxx-GRU",
      "cf-visitor": "{\"scheme\":\"https\"}",
      "host": "ccontroller",
      "user-agent": "insomnia/2022.4.2",
      "x-custom": "potato",
      "x-forwarded-for": "45.444.444.444",
      "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
      "x-request-id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    },
    "path": "/store"
  },
  "additionalParams": "any"
}
```

So, to add support to the above request, we must have registered the `/store` route as `POST` and when DigitalOcean sends this event, you will get:

- `body`: `{"test":true}`
- `queryString`: `potato=true`

## Customizing

You can strip base path with the option `stripBasePath` inside [HttpFunctionAdapterOptions](/docs/api/Adapters/Digital%20Ocean/HttpFunctionAdapter/HttpFunctionAdapterOptions).

:::tip

You can configure this option based on your api base url like: `/api/test-serverless-adapter`, then the request coming from `/api/test-serverless-adapter/events`
will be transformed into `/events`.

:::

## Usage

To add support to DigitalOcean Functions you do the following:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { ServerlessAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter';
import { DigitalOceanHandler } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/handlers/digital-ocean';
import { PromiseResolver } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/resolvers/promise';
import { HttpFunctionAdapter } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/adapters/digital-ocean';
import app from './app';

export const main = ServerlessAdapter.new(app)
  .setHandler(new DigitalOceanHandler())
  .setResolver(new PromiseResolver())
  // continue to set the other options here.
  // .setFramework(new ExpressFramework())
  .addAdapter(new HttpFunctionAdapter())
  .build();
```

## Examples
