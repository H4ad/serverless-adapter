# Architecture

The main purpose of this library is to allow the developer to add support for any cloud and as many event sources as he
wants, without having to create an issue to request the feature or copy the library code because the library doesn't
expose good APIs for you to extend its functionality

So I refactored [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express) with 4 layers of abstraction:
Framework, Handler, Resolver and Adapter.

## Framework

The [FrameworkContract](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/main/src/contracts/framework.contract.ts) is responsible for forwarding
to [IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage)
and [ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse) for your application instance.

With this abstraction you can implement any framework you want, they just need to accept both parameters and
call [end](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse)
in [ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse), so the library knows when to continue
and return the response.

## Handler

The [HandlerContract](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/main/src/contracts/handler.contract.ts) is responsible to get the input from the serverless and then
manage to call each layer of abstraction to return a response.

With this abstraction, you can implement different ways
to receive input from your serverless environment.

They usually have the same structure, but if you need to deal with a
very different cloud, you can use this abstraction to add support for that cloud.

:::tip

Handler is a good choice for implementing (~~monsters~~) ways to receive input.
For example, we can create an http server as its handler to test our serverless code without having to launch the framework. Because? I don't know, but you can.

## Resolver

The [ResolverContract](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/main/src/contracts/resolver.contract.ts) is responsible for waiting for the framework to handle the
request and then returning the response to the cloud. Using AWS for example, you have three ways to wait for the
response: returning a promise, calling the callback, and ~~using in-context methods~~, each option has its own benefits,
but generally the promise option will be the better because any good cloud provider will support promises.

## Adapter

Finally, the masterpiece of this library, the [AdapterContract](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/main/src/contracts/adapter.contract.ts) is responsible for
handling the received event, transforming the request in a way that your application can understand and then
transforming the response in a way your cloud can understand.

Well, with these four contracts, you'll be able to add support to any cloud that exists (no more excuses not to use
cloud X with NodeJS).
