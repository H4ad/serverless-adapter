This feature was initially asked by [ClementCornut](https://github.com/ClementCornut) on issue [#127](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/issues/127).

Initially I was a little unsure whether to publish `esm` and `cjs`, but then I started to like the idea of exporting
my packages as `@h4ad/serverless-adapter/adapters/aws`.

You can use it by installing the new version:

```bash
npm i @h4ad/serverless-adapter@4.0.0
```

In the previous version, since I only export to `commonjs`, you need to import the files as `/lib/adapters/aws`, which is not bad, but not exactly good.
This was necessary because I can't export all files in the default `export` as this will lead you to install all frameworks supported by this library.

But ok, I had some problems while adding support for dual-package publishing which I want to share with you only,
and especially for my future version if you want to add support for dual-package publishing in your modules.

## Vite

I already use `vitest` test my package and to build the previous versions,
it works great and is specially fast to run the tests (5.82s to run 456 tests across 52 files).

But the configuration to build was a little bit nightmare:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
// some initial configuration lines...
  ...(!isTest && {
    esbuild: {
      format: 'cjs',
      platform: 'node',
      target: 'node18',
      sourcemap: 'external',
      minifyIdentifiers: false,
    },
    build: {
      outDir: 'lib',
      emptyOutDir: true,
      sourcemap: true,
      lib: {
        entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.ts'),
        formats: ['cjs'],
      },
      rollupOptions: {
        external: ['yeoman-generator'],
        input: glob.sync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/**/*.ts')),
        output: {
          preserveModules: true,
          entryFileNames: entry => {
            const { name } = entry;

            const fileName = `${name}.js`;

            return fileName;
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }),
```

All of this configuration was necessary as I need to build my package to match exactly the same structure as `src`,
which was needed for users to import as `/lib/adapters/aws`.

On the first attempt, I just tried to extend this configuration, but I spent a few hours and managed to generate
a good package output, but it was missing some details that were very painful to bear, such as correctly emitting `d.cts`.

If you want to see how it turned out, if you want to try doing this using `vite` directly,
[here is vite.config.ts](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/blob/f642739334687b0a22312074a6e225e9f8ac8124/vite.config.ts).

But then I started to give up and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/vinii_joga10/status/1738954683853451760).

## Suggestions from Twitter

I got some incredible helpful messages on twitter and I will cover those suggestions that I applied to be able to finally support dual package publish.

### Re-exporting on mjs

This was a suggestion from [Matteo Collina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina), he also sent me the package [snap](https://github.com/mcollina/snap) which does this re-export,
which I also saw being used in [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama/blob/main/packages/orama/src/cjs/index.cts), is basically doing this:

<BrowserWindow url="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#approach-2-isolate-state">
  Your state:

  ```js title="./node_modules/pkg/state.cjs"
  import Date from 'date';
  const someDate = new Date();
  ```

  Define/export on `cjs`.

  ```js title="./node_modules/pkg/index.cjs"
  const state = require('./state.cjs');
  module.exports.state = state;
  ```

  Re-export on `mjs`.

  ```js title="./node_modules/pkg/index.mjs"
  import state from './state.cjs';
  export {
  state,
};
  ```
</BrowserWindow>

This way, I solve the problem of state isolation, but I will need:

- or manually export all these files
- or use a tool to automate this process

Both ways will be a bit painful to maintain, so I didn't go that route.

This approach can be fine if your library maintains state and the codebase is pure javascript.

### tsup

Instead of trying to go through this configuration hell in `vite`, [Michele Riva](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode)
suggested [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) which is incredibly easy to use.

I spent less than 10 minutes to generate almost the same output as the previous configuration with `vite`,
but this time the output was correct, with `d.cts` files being generated.

My configuration file now looks like this:

```ts title="tsup.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  outDir: './lib',
  clean: true,
  dts: true,
  format: ['esm', 'cjs'],
  // the libEntries is basically all the entries I need to export,
  // like: adapters/aws, frameworks/fastify, etc...
  entry: ['src/index.ts', ...libEntries],
  sourcemap: true,
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true,
  minify: true,
  target: 'es2022',
  tsconfig: './tsconfig.build.json',
  keepNames: true,
  bundle: true,
});
```

Since I have a lot of things to export, I also automate the configuration of `exports` in `package.json` with:

```ts title="tsup.config.ts"
// I do the same for adapters, frameworks and handlers
const resolvers = ['aws-context', 'callback', 'dummy', 'promise'];

const libEntries = [
  ...resolvers.map(resolver => `src/resolvers/${resolver}/index.ts`),
];

const createExport = (filePath: string) => ({
  import: {
    types: `./lib/${filePath}.d.ts`,
    default: `./lib/${filePath}.js`,
  },
  require: {
    types: `./lib/${filePath}.d.cts`,
    default: `./lib/${filePath}.cjs`,
  },
});

const createExportReducer =
  (initialPath: string) => (acc: object, name: string) => {
    acc[`./${initialPath}/${name}`] = createExport(
      `${initialPath}/${name}/index`,
    );

    return acc;
  };

const packageExports = {
  '.': createExport('index'),
  ...resolvers.reduce(createExportReducer('resolvers'), {}),
  // and I also do the same for adapters, frameworks and handlers.
};

// this command does the magic to update my package.json
execSync(`npm pkg set exports='${JSON.stringify(packageExports)}' --json`);
```

This works incredible and also keep my `package.json` updated.

### publint

The [publint](https://publint.dev/) is a tool that I learned on [ESM Modernization Lessons](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2023/08/esm-modernization-lessons/#early-attempts) inside `Early Attempts`,
this article was a suggestion by [Luca Micieli](https://twitter.com/LucaRams23).

With this tool, I detect several problems with the `exports` configuration and this will make your life a lot easier.

But this tool has a problem that they didn't catch, and this problem was pointed out by [Michele Riva](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode), instead:

```json title="package.json"
"exports": {
  "resolvers/promise": {
```

I should export it with the prefix `./`:

```json title="package.json"
"exports": {
  "./resolvers/promise": {
```

This small detail can make your configuration fail.

### verdaccio

The [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) was suggested by [Abhijeet Prasad](https://twitter.com/imabhiprasad), with this tool you can have your private registry that you can use to test,
Abhijeet use this tool on [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) SDKs to do e2e tests.

With this tool, I was able to make sure the package was working correctly with the new dual package publish.

### Wrong `moduleResolution`

It took me a while to realize, but while testing the changes in a sample project, the imports still failed because TypeScript couldn't find the files.

So I remember the suggestion from [sami](https://twitter.com/samijaber_) who gave me some examples of projects he uses
in [BuilderIO/hidration-overlay](https://github.com/BuilderIO/hydration-overlay/tree/main/tests),
and I understand the difference between `moduleResolution`, in my project it was configured for `node`,
in his project it was configured for `bundler`.

When I changed this setting, all imports started working and imports using `/lib/adapters/aws` started failing.

If you're like me and have no idea what this setting is about, the documentation says:

<BrowserWindow url="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution">
  Specify the module resolution strategy:

  'node16' or 'nodenext' for modern versions of Node.js. Node.js v12 and later supports both ECMAScript imports and
  CommonJS require, which resolve using different algorithms. These moduleResolution values, when combined with the
  corresponding module values, picks the right algorithm for each resolution based on whether Node.js will see an import
  or require in the output JavaScript code.

  'node10' (previously called 'node') for Node.js versions older than v10, which only support CommonJS require. You
  probably wonâ€™t need to use node10 in modern code.

  'bundler' for use with bundlers. Like node16 and nodenext, this mode supports package.json "imports" and "exports",
  but unlike the Node.js resolution modes, bundler never requires file extensions on relative paths in imports.
</BrowserWindow>

Make sense why it was not working at all, `node` was not built to support `exports`, and only `nodenext` and `bundler` should work correctly.

## Doubling the package size

Something I saw that made me a little worried was the size of this package, since I need to export the code, types and source maps twice, the package
went from `~600Kb` to `~1.5Mb`.

I enabled minification to try to reduce the amount of code shipped, but if you use this library and don't have any kind of minification/bundling
during your build, I highly recommend you look into these libraries to help you with the size of your zip file being uploaded:

- [@h4ad/node-modules-packer](https://github.com/H4ad/node-modules-packer)
- [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
- [zip-it-and-ship-it](https://github.com/netlify/zip-it-and-ship-it)

## Conclusions

The `esm` packages was a nightmare to support some time ago but the ecosystem is starting solving problems with new tools to bundle your project
instead of having to fight with your own configuration files.

The `cjs` is a no-brain solution, almost no configuration and it works great but maybe is not ideal for your consumers/clients, some of them can have issues
like [ClementCornut](https://github.com/ClementCornut) that needed to import the files with the full path `import awsPkg from "@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/adapters/aws/index.js";`.

When I started adding this feature, I had no knowledge of how to publish double packages, I basically go-horse in the early hours
of my implementation and then I started learning more about how it works and how to properly configure the package.

This makes me realize that dual-package publishing isn't the nightmare I initially thought, I just didn't learn from the
previous mistakes other people made and I should have read more articles about it before I started implementing it.

My sincere thanks to:

- [Abhijeet Prasad](https://twitter.com/imabhiprasad)
- [Luca Micieli](https://twitter.com/LucaRams23)
- [Matteo Collina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina)
- [Michele Riva](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode)
- [sami](https://twitter.com/samijaber_)

Without you, it will probably take me a lot longer to be able to convince myself to go ahead and try again to add support
for dual-package publish after the first failures.
