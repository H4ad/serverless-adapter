title: Creating an Adapter
position: 2

As we saw in [Introduction](./introduction), you are already familiar with adapter methods.

In this chapter, we will create a new adapter to implement the [AWS Api Gateway V2](../adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2)
that has the request and response in the following format:

## Request and Response

```json title="request.json"
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "routeKey": "$default",
  "rawPath": "/my/path",
  "rawQueryString": "parameter1=value1&parameter1=value2&parameter2=value",
  "cookies": [
    "cookie1",
    "cookie2"
  ],
  "headers": {
    "header1": "value1",
    "header2": "value1,value2"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": {
    "parameter1": "value1,value2",
    "parameter2": "value"
  },
  "requestContext": {
    "accountId": "123456789012",
    "apiId": "api-id",
    "authentication": {
      "clientCert": {
        "clientCertPem": "CERT_CONTENT",
        "subjectDN": "www.example.com",
        "issuerDN": "Example issuer",
        "serialNumber": "a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1:a1",
        "validity": {
          "notBefore": "May 28 12:30:02 2019 GMT",
          "notAfter": "Aug  5 09:36:04 2021 GMT"
        }
      }
    },
    "authorizer": {
      "jwt": {
        "claims": {
          "claim1": "value1",
          "claim2": "value2"
        },
        "scopes": [
          "scope1",
          "scope2"
        ]
      }
    },
    "domainName": "id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
    "domainPrefix": "id",
    "http": {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/my/path",
      "protocol": "HTTP/1.1",
      "sourceIp": "IP",
      "userAgent": "agent"
    },
    "requestId": "id",
    "routeKey": "$default",
    "stage": "$default",
    "time": "12/Mar/2020:19:03:58 +0000",
    "timeEpoch": 1583348638390
  },
  "body": "Hello from Lambda",
  "pathParameters": {
    "parameter1": "value1"
  },
  "isBase64Encoded": false,
  "stageVariables": {
    "stageVariable1": "value1",
    "stageVariable2": "value2"
  }
}
```


```json title="response.json"
{
    "isBase64Encoded": true,
    "statusCode": 201,
    "headers": { "headername": "headervalue" },
    "multiValueHeaders": { "headername": ["headervalue", "headervalue2"] },
    "body": "Done"
}
```

## Creating the class

First, we need to create our new adapter class, let's define it as:

```typescript title="api-gateway-v2.adapter.ts"
import type { APIGatewayProxyEventV2, Context } from 'aws-lambda';
import type { APIGatewayProxyStructuredResultV2 } from 'aws-lambda/trigger/api-gateway-proxy';
import { AdapterContract } from '@h4ad/serverless-adapter/lib/contracts';

export class ApiGatewayV2Adapter implements AdapterContract<APIGatewayProxyEventV2, Context, APIGatewayProxyStructuredResultV2> {}
```

The interface we need to implement is [AdapterContract](../../api/Contracts/AdapterContract) which takes 3 generic arguments:
the event sent by the event source, the context of the serverless environment, and the response that the event source understands.

## Implementing the `getAdapterName` method

This is the easiest method to implement, we can do it as follows:

```typescript title="api-gateway-v2.adapter.ts"
public getAdapterName(): string {
  return ApiGatewayV2Adapter.name;
}
```

## Implementing the `canHandle` method

When we implement this method, we must study the request event to know which properties are always sent by the event source,
in case of [AWS Api Gateway V2](../adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2), the most important ones are `requestContext` and `version` and
checking that the value of `version` is equal to `2.0`.

This way, we can implement if the event was sent from [AWS Api Gateway V2](../adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2) as follows:

```typescript title="api-gateway-v2.adapter.ts"
public canHandle(event: unknown): event is APIGatewayProxyEventV2 {
  const apiGatewayEvent = event as Partial<APIGatewayProxyEventV2> & {
    version?: string;
  };

  // this basically will verify if:
  // - if event has requestContext
  // - if event has version property equal to 2.0
  // if both are true, then we do double bang
  // just to make sure we return boolean
  return !!(
    apiGatewayEvent?.requestContext && apiGatewayEvent.version === '2.0'
  );
}
```

## Implementing the `getRequest` method

In this method, we need to return the [AdapterRequest](../../api/Contracts/AdapterContract/AdapterRequest) interface,
to understand better what we need to return, let's look at the table below:
