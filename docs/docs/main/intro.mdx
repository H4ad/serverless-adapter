# Introduction

This library was a refactored version of [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express), I
create a new way to interact and extend event sources by creating contracts to abstract the integrations between each
library layer.

Why you would use this libray instead of [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express)?

- Better APIs to extend library functionality.
  - You don't need me to release a new version to integrate with the new event source, you can create an adapter and
    just call the `addAdapter` method when building your handler.
- All code can be extended, if you want to modify the current behavior you can.
  - This is important because if you find a bug, you can quickly resolve it by extending the class, _and then you can
    submit a PR to fix the bug_.
- All code was written in Typescript.
- We have >99% coverage.

## Support

:::caution

We are in beta, so some adapters may not work as expected, feel free to create an issue or provide feedback on current behavior.

:::

By design we have these contracts that define the layers of the library: Frameworks, Adapters, Resolvers and Handlers.

:::info

If you don't know what each thing means, see [Architecture](./architecture).

:::

Currently, we support these frameworks:

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with ([ExpressFramework](src/frameworks/express/express.framework.ts)) or ([FastifyFramework](src/frameworks/fastify/fastify.framework.ts)).
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) by using ([ExpressFramework](src/frameworks/express/express.framework.ts))
- [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) by using ([FastifyFramework](src/frameworks/fastify/fastify.framework.ts))
- [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) by using ([HapiFramework](src/frameworks/hapi/hapi.framework.ts))
- [Koa](https://koajs.com/) by using ([KoaFramework](src/frameworks/koa/koa.framework.ts))

We support these event sources:

- AWS
  - [AWS Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-alb.html) by
    using ([AlbAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/alb.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS Api Gateway V1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html)
    by using ([ApiGatewayV1Adapter](./src/adapters/aws/api-gateway-v1.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS Api Gateway V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html)
    by using ([ApiGatewayV2Adapter](./src/adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html) by
    using ([DynamoDBAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/dynamodb.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS Event Bridge / CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents.html)
    by using ([EventBridgeAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/event-bridge.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS Lambda Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html) by
    using ([LambdaEdgeAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/lambda-edge.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sns.html) by
    using ([SNSAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/sns.adapter.ts))
  - [AWS SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html) by
    using ([SQSAdapter](./src/adapters/aws/sqs.adapter.ts))
- Azure
  - The support is coming soon.
- Huawei
  - The support is coming soon.

We support these resolvers:

- Promise by using ([PromiseResolver](src/resolvers/promise/promise.resolver.ts))
- Callback by using ([CallbackResolver](src/resolvers/callback/callback.resolver.ts))
- AWS Context by using ([AwsContextResolver](src/resolvers/aws-context/aws-context.resolver.ts))

We support these handlers:

- Default by using ([DefaultHandler](src/handlers/default/default.handler.ts))

## Why you create this library?

The real reason I created this library was because I wanted to add API Gateway and SQS support at the same time to save
some money. But, [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express) was not supported, so
I [created a PR](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express/pull/483) ~~but until I finished this library that PR was never accepted~~ and it was merged but it took so long.

So I build my own library based on that library with better APIs so I never have to wait for the maintainer to accept my
PR just to extend the library's functionality :)

## Credits

Honestly, I just refactored all the code that the @vendia team and many other contributors wrote, thanks so much to them
for existing and giving us a brilliant library that is the core of my current company.
