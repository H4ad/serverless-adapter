moon!](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1636819488524-1f019c4e1c44)\\n\\nNow we have more Handlers, Frameworks and Adapters, let\'s see what\'s new.\\n\\n> From [v2.3.2](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/v2.3.2) to [v2.6.0](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/v2.6.0),\\ncompare the changes [here](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/compare/v2.3.2...v2.6.0).\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\n42 commits, 6905 lines added, 601 lines deleted, that\'s the size of the changes since [The Beginning](/blog/the-beginning).\\n\\nI\'m very proud of how things are going, I learned a lot by studying to implement these new things.\\n\\nBut, let\'s learn what\'s new in all these releases.\\n\\n## Azure and Firebase\\n\\nYou can now use this library to deploy your apps to [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-node)\\nand [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/http-events).\\n\\nMore specifically, you can integrate with Http Trigger V4 on Azure and Http Events on Firebase.\\n\\nThese integrations are just to open the door of possibilities, in the future I want to add support for more triggers in these clouds.\\n\\nCheck out the [Azure](/docs/main/handlers/azure) and [Firebase](/docs/main/handlers/firebase) docs for how to integrate.\\n\\nI also added examples for the cloud in the [serverless-adapter-examples](https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter-examples) repository.\\n\\n## tRPC\\n\\n<BrowserWindow url=\\"https://trpc.io/docs/\\">\\n  tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs, without schemas or code generation.\\n</BrowserWindow>\\n\\ntRPC is a framework that brings a new way of thinking about APIs, instead of REST or GraphQL, you can build typesafe APIs and easily\\ncan integrate with the client, seems to be very promising.\\n\\nSo now you can deploy applications developed with tRPC to any cloud that this library supports, have a look at [docs](/docs/main/frameworks/trpc)\\nto learn more about how to use it.\\n\\n## That\'s all folks!\\n\\nI have two more weeks to work in this library without worrying because I\'m on vacation at the university,\\nso probably my next efforts will be to bring more articles to this blog to show the full power of this library.\\n\\nGiving some spoilers for those of you that make it this far, I\'ll start by showing you the benefits of using AWS Lambda integrated with\\nAPI Gateway and SQS, I used it in a project of my company and I managed to reduce a lot of stress on the database and now\\nwe are able to process 500k votes in minutes without spending 15% CPU using a PostgreSQL database on a t2.micro instance.\\n\\nThat\'s all for today, thank you!"},{"id":"the-beginning","metadata":{"permalink":"/serverless-adapter/blog/the-beginning","editUrl":"https://github.com/H4ad/serverless-adapter/tree/main/www/blog/2022-06-17-the-beginning.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-17-the-beginning.mdx","title":"The

new library to help you integrate your API with the serverless world.\\n\\n## The development\\n\\nIt took me almost 5 months to build this library, refactoring was easy and testing was challenging, but documenting this library was the hardest part.\\n\\nIt took me almost 2 weeks to refactor [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express),\\nabout 1 and a half month to create tests with 99% coverage and the rest of the time I spent creating documentation for this library.\\n\\nI currently added support for:\\n\\n- AWS\\n  - [AWS Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-alb.html) by using ([AlbAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/alb))\\n  - [AWS Api Gateway V1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) by using ([ApiGatewayV1Adapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/api-gateway-v1))\\n  - [AWS Api Gateway V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) by using ([ApiGatewayV2Adapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/api-gateway-v2))\\n  - [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html) by using ([DynamoDBAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/dynamodb))\\n  - [AWS Event Bridge / CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents.html) by using ([EventBridgeAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/event-bridge))\\n  - [AWS Lambda Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html) by using ([LambdaEdgeAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/lambda-edge))\\n  - [AWS SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sns.html) by using ([SNSAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/sns))\\n  - [AWS SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html) by using ([SQSAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/aws/sqs))\\n- Huawei\\n  - [Http Function](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-functiongraph/functiongraph_01_1442.html): Look [this section](/docs/main/handlers/huawei#http-function).\\n  - [Event Function](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-functiongraph/functiongraph_01_1441.html): Look [this section](/docs/main/handlers/huawei#event-function).\\n    - [Api Gateway](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/devg-functiongraph/functiongraph_02_0102.html#functiongraph_02_0102__li5178638110137) by using ([HuaweiApiGatewayAdapter](/docs/main/adapters/huawei/huawei-api-gateway)).\\n\\nBut it\'s just the beginning, I\'m going to build more adapters to integrate with as much of the cloud as possible, just to be able to deploy my APIs on any cloud.\\n\\n## About me\\n\\nI am a student at [Facens](https://facens.br/) university and I work for [Liga](https://liga.facens.br/), which is a sector within Facens that develops applications, websites, games and much more fun stuff.\\n\\nI currently work on this library only in my spare time and I need to balance my Final Theses and my overtime projects so it was very challenging but I am happy with the end result of this library.\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nThis library was originally created to help my company reduce costs with AWS SQS, but it has since turned into something I can spend my time developing and learning English because I\'m not a native speaker (as typing problems might suggest) writing all the documentation in English.\\n## Credits\\n\\nI need to thank [@vendia](https://vendia.net/) for developing [@vendia/serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express), all logic and code I finished to refactor from the code I read on serverless-express.\\nI also have many thanks to [Chaguri](https://github.com/guichaguri), [Liga](https://liga.facens.br/) and many other people who gave me time and insights to create this library.\\n\\n## You can use it right now!\\n\\nSee the [Introduction](/docs/main/intro) section to know more about the library."}]}')}}]);
